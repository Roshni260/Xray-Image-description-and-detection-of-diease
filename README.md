## Helloüòä!!

In this project I have used  Sequential Model(Machine Learning Model) as well Deep Learning Modeli.e VGG-16 to analyse and detect TB so that we can understand which model gives highest Accuracy. 

### Algorithms Implemented are:
#### CNN:SEQUENTIAL MODEL
The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. You can create a Sequential model by passing a list of layer instances to the constructor.The model needs to know what input shape it should expect. For this reason, the first layer in a Sequential model (and only the first, because following layers can do automatic shape inference) needs to receive information about its input shape. Before training a model, you need to configure the learning process, which is done via the compile method.Keras models are trained on Numpy arrays of input data and labels. For training a model, you will typically use the fit function.
#### CNN:VGG16 MODEL
In VGG16 there are thirteen convolutional layers, five Max Pooling layers and three Dense layers which sum up to 21 layers but it has only sixteen weight layers i.e learnable parameters layer.
It has convolution layers of 3√ó3 filter with a stride 1 and always used the same padding and maxpool layer of 2√ó2 filter of stride 2. The input to Conv 1 layer is of fixed size 224 x 224 RGB image.
